# Single Sign-On

This project provides a standard for implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) within our organization. The documentation outlines guidelines and best practices for securely and efficiently integrating SSO into internal applications. By using SSO, users can access multiple systems with a single set of credentials, improving both user experience and security while simplifying management.

Please note that the documentation is only visible to developers who have access to the Amsterdam organization in GitHub.

For more details and the full documentation, please visit the official repository via the following link: [SSO Documentation](https://github.com/Amsterdam/development-standards/tree/main/internal/sso).
