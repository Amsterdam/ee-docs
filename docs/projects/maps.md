# Leaflet maps in React

Amsterdam's preferred map library is <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> and frontend framework is <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>. Combining Leaflet with the React component lifecycle can provide some challenges. Therefore, we have created a repository and Storybook application to browse common map components and feature examples.

You can browse the project at [https://amsterdam.github.io/ee-react-map-demos](https://amsterdam.github.io/ee-react-map-demos).
