# Secure Mail Relay

This project provides a standard for implementing the Secure Mail Relay (SMR) within our organization. The documentation outlines guidelines and best practices for securely and efficiently integrating SMR into internal applications. By using SMR, applications can securely send emails while ensuring compliance with authentication and security policies.

Please note that this documentation is only visible to developers who have access to the Amsterdam organization in GitHub.
