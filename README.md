# Engineering Enablement Docs

Team responsible: Engineering Enablement team

This is a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) application. The Markdown files in the `docs` directory are imported from the [amsterdam/development-standards project](https://github.com/Amsterdam/development-standards).

## Aims of this repo

This repository strives to offer a comprehensive overview of the standards presently utilized within the developer community at the municipality of the city of Amsterdam. Additionally, it encompasses a summary of both rejected and under-review standards. You can access the overview by following this link.

## How to use this repo?

Within the `docs/general` directory, you will find descriptions of standards that apply regardless of whether you identify as a back- or frontend developer. In the `backend` and `frontend` directories, you can locate standards specifically tailored for each respective group of developers.

If a standard is labeled as a recommendation, it indicates that it is not widely embraced by our developer community.

## How to contribute to this repo?

If you would like to include additional standards, please refer to the [manual for instructions on implementing new standards](https://developers.amsterdam/docs/general/project-documentation). If you have any other matters to bring to our attention, you can contact us via Slack (#engineering-enablement) or Teams (DV - Engineering Enablement).
